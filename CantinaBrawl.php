  <h1>Cantina Brawl</h1>
  <br/><br/>
  <p>
      Welcome to the Cantina! Prepare to Brawl! Currently featured: <span class="ref-page-brawl-current">Padawan</span>
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h2>What is Cantina Brawl?</h2>
  <p>
    Cantina Brawl is a gameplay format on Petranaki.net that features a periodically rotating game mode! The modes you'll experience in the Cantina may require you to construct SWU decks with certain restrictions, play with pre-built themed decks, and even, on occasion, change some rules of the game entirely!
  </p>

  <h2>How do I know what the Cantina Brawl rules are?</h2>
  <p>
    If you try to enter a Cantina Brawl lobby with an invalid deck, an error should be displayed showing you the current rules as well as a list of what cards in your chosen deck violate those rules. Alternatively, you can visit this page for a list of all Cantina Brawl mode rules!
  </p>

  <h2>How often does the featured game mode rotate?</h2>
  <p>
    Since Cantina Brawl is new, we don't have a solid answer to this question just yet. We are still developing new modes in between squashing bugs found in Premier. Ideally, once a decent number of Cantina Brawl modes have been implemented, we imagine Cantina Brawl modes will rotate each week.
  </p>

  <h2>What if I want to play a mode that rotated out and is no longer featured?</h2>
  <p>
    Unfortunately the nature of the Cantina means modes will come and go over time, but don't worry, it shall return (and in greater numbers too... maybe)!  Also, we'd love to hear which modes you enjoy most, so please join our <a class="ref-page-link" href="https://discord.gg/ep9fj8Vj3F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a>  and leave some feedback!
  </p>

  <h2>How many cards can be in a Cantina Brawl deck?</h2>
  <p>
    The standard SWU deckbuilding requirements, such as a 50-card minimum, 3 maximum copies per card, and a 10-card sideboard, all remain true while playing in the Cantina unless the featured game mode specifically mentions otherwise!
