  <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
  <p>
    By playing on Petranaki.net, users agree to the following rules of conduct:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      First and foremost, remember that this is a game. Everyone is here to have fun. If you're behaving in such a way that is meant to cause your opponent to have a bad time, you may want to go home and rethink your life.
    </li>
    <li>
      That being said, if someone is playing a card/deck you don't like, there's no need to complain about it in chat. Simply move along by leaving the game and finding another.
    </li>
    <li>
      Respect each other. Harassment of any kind will not be tolerated. This includes (but is not limited to) abusing the "Undo" feature.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you have an issue with another player, you may report them by opening a support ticket on our <a class="ref-page-link" href="https://discord.gg/ep9fj8Vj3F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a> server.
    </li>
    <li>
      Keep usernames and lobby names appropriate. If a moderator deems a username inappropriate, it may result in a ban. Bans can be appealed on our Discord server.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="ref-page-conduct-disclaimer">
    These rules are subject to change as necessary.
